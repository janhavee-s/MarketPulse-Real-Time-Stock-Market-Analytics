# 📈 MarketPulse: Real-Time Stock Market Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

MarketPulse is a financial analytics project designed to analyze and visualize stock market performance using historical market data. The system leverages Python-based data analysis techniques to compare stock performance, evaluate investment risk, identify market trends, and generate actionable insights through data visualization.

By integrating financial data from Yahoo Finance, the project enables investors and analysts to monitor stock behavior, compare multiple assets, assess volatility, and understand long-term market movements using quantitative techniques.

## Objectives

* Retrieve historical stock market data using Yahoo Finance.
* Compare the performance of multiple stocks over a selected time period.
* Analyze daily returns and market behavior.
* Measure stock volatility as a risk indicator.
* Identify trends using moving averages.
* Generate visual insights through financial data visualization.
* Support data-driven investment analysis and decision-making.

---

## Dataset

The project utilizes financial market data obtained through the Yahoo Finance API via the yFinance library.

Data includes:

* Historical Stock Prices
* Closing Prices
* Daily Returns
* Market Volatility Metrics
* Moving Average Trends

Stocks analyzed in the project:

* Apple (AAPL)
* Microsoft (MSFT)
* Google (GOOGL)

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**
* **yFinance**

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection

Historical stock data is downloaded directly from Yahoo Finance using the yFinance library.

The system retrieves:

* Daily Closing Prices
* Historical Trading Data
* Market Performance Information

---

### 2. Data Normalization

Stock prices are normalized to allow fair comparison between companies with different share prices.

This enables performance analysis on a common scale.

---

### 3. Performance Analysis

Normalized stock prices are compared over time to evaluate relative growth and market performance.

Key metrics include:

* Price Growth
* Relative Performance
* Historical Trends

---

### 4. Daily Return Analysis

Daily percentage returns are calculated to measure short-term market fluctuations.

This analysis helps identify:

* Price Momentum
* Daily Market Movement
* Return Variability

---

### 5. Risk Assessment

Volatility is calculated using the standard deviation of daily returns.

Higher volatility indicates:

* Greater market uncertainty
* Increased investment risk

Lower volatility indicates:

* More stable stock performance

---

### 6. Moving Average Analysis

A 50-day Moving Average (MA) is calculated to smooth short-term fluctuations and reveal long-term trends.

Moving averages help:

* Identify trend direction
* Detect market momentum
* Support investment decision-making

---

## Key Features

* Historical Stock Market Analysis
* Multi-Stock Performance Comparison
* Daily Return Analysis
* Volatility-Based Risk Assessment
* 50-Day Moving Average Analysis
* Financial Data Visualization
* Market Trend Identification
* Investment Insight Generation

## Visualizations

The project generates:

### Stock Performance Comparison

Compares normalized stock prices across multiple companies.

### Daily Return Analysis
